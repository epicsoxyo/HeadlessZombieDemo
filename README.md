# Headless Zombie Demo

Welcome to the Headless Zombie Demo repository! This project was created as part of my master's degree assessment at Manchester Metropolitan University. I was asked to invent and implement a new game mechanic using Unity and UE5, with the aim of comparing the two engines. What you see here is the Unity component of the assignment.

## Overview

The demo features a unique game mechanic where a headless zombie's body only chases the player if they are detected by the zombie's head. Additionally, the demo includes a dynamic camera system, a cone of detection, and a tracking ball to showcase exactly how the mechanic works. These can each be toggled via the buttons and camera dropdown menu in the UI.

## Technologies Used

For this particular project, I used Unity 2022.3.5f1 (LTS) and C#.

## Features

- Headless zombie enemy whose body chases players currently located within the head's line of sight
- Dynamic camera angles (switchable via UI dropdown)
- Cone of detection (can be toggled)
- Tracking ball (can be toggled)

## Demo

## Usage

To explore the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity 2022.3.5f1
3. The code and assets are available for you to see for yourself.

The demo is also available as a .unitypackage for you to import to a Unity project.
